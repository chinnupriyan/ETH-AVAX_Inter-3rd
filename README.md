# Kalyan KLN-20 Token

## Overview

KALYAN is an ERC-20 token deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It is implemented using the OpenZeppelin library, providing standard ERC-20 features with additional functionalities such as burning and permit for easy token approvals.

## Contract Features

### ERC-20 Standard

KALYAN follows the ERC-20 standard, allowing it to be used with various decentralized applications (DApps), wallets, and exchanges that support ERC-20 tokens.

### Minting

The contract owner has the exclusive ability to mint new KALYAN tokens into any account. This feature enables the owner to increase the token supply when needed.

### Burning

Any token holder can burn their RYZEN tokens. Burning reduces the total supply, providing a mechanism for users to remove tokens from circulation.

### Permit

KALYAN supports the ERC-2612 permit function, allowing users to approve token transfers with a signature instead of a direct transaction. This feature enhances gas efficiency for certain interactions.

## Deployment

The KALYAN contract is deployed on the Ethereum mainnet with the initial supply of 10 RYZEN tokens. The contract owner is set to the specified initial owner address.
